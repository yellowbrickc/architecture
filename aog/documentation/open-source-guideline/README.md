# Guideline to Publish cleverbridge Components as Open Source

## License

Use MIT or BSD 3 clause.

## What To Consider (draft, will be refined in the future)

1. Check the license of all third-party dependencies. If they use a different license:
  - This license must not be breached.
  - If they are published along our component they must still have the "old" license
2. Check if the component works as intended and does no harm when used as intended
3. Please assure that when publishing the component
  - No indications regarding the business activity or business secrets of our clients can be found
  - No indications regarding the identity of a colleague (except they have agreet to be mentioned)
  - No promises or properties are mentioned in the documentation which are not verifyable
  - The publication shall be justifiable from a business perspective:
      - It shall not contain central or important business capabilities of our platform
      - It shall not be possible to infer conclusions about central or important business capabilities of our platform
      - It shall not contain business secrets of cleverbridge
      - It shall be mature and pass a certain quality standard
      - It shall be reviewed by TBD
