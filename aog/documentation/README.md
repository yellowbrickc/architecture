# Architecture Owner Group

The [Architecture Owner Group](https://sharepoint.cgn.cleverbridge.com/Development/SitePages/Architecture%20Owner%20Group.aspx) (AOG) is one of currently three [guilds](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/) we have founded for the Subscription Platform development so far. Next to this guild there are the [Quality Owner Group](https://sharepoint.cgn.cleverbridge.com/Development/SitePages/Quality%20Owner%20Group.aspx) (QOG) and the [Frontend Owner Group](https://sharepoint.cgn.cleverbridge.com/Development/SitePages/Subscription%20Frontend%20Group.aspx) (FOG).

As members of the AOG we aim [general goals](./aog-definition/README.md) to create an environment of robust technical architecture and economic decisions. It is very important to us that all participants head into the same direction in the most efficient way. To achieve that, there is an [Architectural outline](./architectural-outline/README.md), which gives some guidelines. We want to build the right things in the right way.
