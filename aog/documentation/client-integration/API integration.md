# API integration

## General efforts

- documentation
- API authorization
- unified API design (all teams should expose API in the same way)
- expecting to have more client developer support efforts
- taking care about downwards compatibility from day 0

## Open question (scope)

- How do we want to offer an API documentation?
- Do we want to offer localization support via API?
- Do we want to support both REST API and GraphQl API?
- Do we want to support for both at the same time API and hosted pages?
- How to get payment profile information when supporting only API?
- Does the current flow fits the needs for an API approach? (1st choose signup offer, 2nd create Customer, 3rd create payment profile, 4th create subscription, ...) 
- Do we support signup offers at the API approach?

## Open question (general)

- When is expected to serve the market with APIs?

## Concerns

- When starting now to rollout APIs, we do not expect to have a "ready-to-integrate" API at the end of the current milestone "Monetize"
